# <span style="color:#193f7d">SC Technical College Database Management System</span>

<p style="text-align:center"><img style ="align:center" src="college_banner.jpg"></p>

## Description

This project involved the design and implementation of an updated database management system for the *SC Technical College* educational network. This features a RDBMS created in the MS Access and MySQL Workbench environments, housing all of the required data for the schools specified. A total of 11 college profiles were created, each allowing the permissible user to manage student & teacher data records, update curriculum information, and run reports as necessary. This focuses solely on the back-end area of development, primarily concentrating on the full database framework, which will eventually evolve into a front-end interface.
